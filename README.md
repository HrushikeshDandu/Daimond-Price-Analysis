# Daimond-Price-Analysis
A comprehensive Python project for analyzing diamond prices using machine learning and data visualization. This project explores the relationship between diamond characteristics (carat, cut, color, clarity, etc.) and their market prices.
## Features

Data Exploration: Comprehensive analysis of diamond dataset
Interactive Visualizations: Beautiful charts using Plotly
Machine Learning: Random Forest model for price prediction
Feature Engineering: Advanced data preprocessing and feature creation
Price Prediction: Interactive tool to predict diamond prices
Export Results: Save processed data and model predictions

## Visualizations
The project generates four main visualizations:

Carat vs Price - Scatter plot with trend line
Size vs Price - Volume-based price analysis
Price Distribution by Cut and Color - Box plots
Price Distribution by Cut and Clarity - Box plots

## Installation
Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed on your system.
Required Libraries
Install the required packages using pip:
bashpip install pandas numpy plotly scikit-learn
Or install from requirements.txt:
bashpip install -r requirements.txt
Dataset
You'll need the diamonds.csv dataset. You can download it from:

Kaggle Diamonds Dataset
Or any other source containing diamond data with the following columns:

carat, cut, color, clarity, depth, table, price, x, y, z

## Usage
Running the Analysis

Clone the repository:
bashgit clone https://github.com/yourusername/diamond-price-analysis.git
cd diamond-price-analysis

Install dependencies:
bashpip install -r requirements.txt

Download the dataset:

Download diamonds.csv and place it in the project directory


Run the analysis:
bashpython diamond_analysis.py


Interactive Price Prediction
The script includes an interactive price prediction tool. When prompted, enter:

Carat Size: Weight of the diamond (e.g., 1.5)
Cut Type: 1=Ideal, 2=Premium, 3=Good, 4=Very Good, 5=Fair
Color: 1=D (best) to 7=J (worst)
Clarity: 1=FL (best) to 9=I1 (worst)
Depth: Depth percentage (e.g., 62.5)
Table: Table percentage (e.g., 57.0)
Size: Volume/Size (e.g., 25.0)

## Model Performance
The Random Forest model achieves:

R-squared Score: ~0.85-0.95 (85-95% accuracy)
Features Used: Carat, Cut, Color, Clarity, Depth, Table, Size
Training/Testing Split: 80/20

Feature Importance
The model identifies the most important factors affecting diamond prices:

Carat - Weight of the diamond
Size - Volume (length × width × depth)
Color - Color grade
Clarity - Clarity grade
Cut - Cut quality
Depth - Depth percentage
Table - Table percentage

## Output Files
The script generates several output files:

diamonds_processed.csv - Cleaned and processed dataset
model_predictions.csv - Model predictions vs actual prices
feature_importance.csv - Feature importance rankings

## Data Processing
The analysis includes:

Data Cleaning: Removal of invalid entries and missing values
Feature Engineering: Creation of volume-based size feature
Encoding: Conversion of categorical variables to numerical
Correlation Analysis: Identification of price-related factors

## Key Insights
Based on the analysis, you'll discover:

Strong correlation between carat weight and price
Impact of cut quality on pricing
Price variations across different color and clarity grades
Relationship between diamond dimensions and value
